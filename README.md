# Programming Exercises for Computational Topology
This repository contains exercises that were given to students of the course "Computational Topology" at [University of Potsdam](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/de/) in 2022. The lecture was given by Prof. Myf Evans. The courses contents were based on Herbert Edelsbrunners [Computational Topology: An Introduction.](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/papers/edelcomp.pdf)

The exercises aim at introducing the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) programming language and ask to implement algorithms discussed in the lecture.  

You will need to have Jupyter installed and Julia set up for it. See [here](https://datatofish.com/add-julia-to-jupyter/) for a step by step explanation.

Feel free to use these in any way you see fit.
