# computational_topology_exercises
This repository contains exercises that were given to students of the course "Computational Topology" at University of Potsdam in 2022. The course was taught by Prof. Myf Evans. The courses contents were based on Herbert Edelsbrunners "Computational Topology: An Introduction."

The exercises introduced the students to the Julia programming language and asked them to implement algorithms discussed in the lecture. 

Feel free to use these in any way you see fit.
